# Team1_BioCapstone

We are creating a website that takes body composition data from user input and displays the minimum amount of steps needed to lose body fat. 

We will be using the Spearman's Rho formula that will express the steps relative to fat mass:<br>
(STEPS∙kg of fat mass-1∙day-1)

STEPS = (steps∙day-1)<br>
kg of fat mass-1 = (1/kg of fat mass)<br>
day-1 = (1/day)<br>
